# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### Project Overview: Multi-Step Quiz Application

#### Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly, responsive quiz application with a multi-step form interface. The application will guide users through the process of selecting a quiz category, answering quiz questions, and viewing results,   Timer limit , Hint Functionality and dark mode,all while ensuring smooth navigation and input validation at each step.

#### Key Features:

1. ## Step 1: Category Selection

     - User progress will be tracked, and the interface will be responsive to different screen sizes.

2. ## Step 2: Quiz Questions

     - The application will display one question at a time with multiple-choice answers.
     - "Previous" and "Next" buttons will be available to navigate between questions.
     - Navigation will be controlled so that users cannot skip questions without providing an answer.
   - ## Functionality:
     - Each question must be answered before proceeding to the next.
     - The form will validate that an answer is selected before allowing navigation to the next question.
     - The user’s progress through the quiz will be visually tracked, and the interface will adapt to different screen sizes.

3. ## Step 3: Quiz Results
   - ## User Interface:
     - Once all questions are answered, the user’s score will be displayed along with the correct answers.
     - The results screen will offer options to retake the quiz or return to the category selection step.
   - ## Functionality ##:
     - The final score will be calculated based on the user’s responses.
     - The correct answers will be shown for each question, allowing the user to review their performance.
     - Users will have the option to start over by selecting a new category or retake the quiz in the same category.
 4. ## Add On Features are:
 - Timer Functionality added, when time limit is up it shows dialog box time is up move to next question
 - Hint Functionality added , When user confuse for the answer then user click on hint icon and hint are shown for correct      answer.
 - Dark Mode Functionality added- User Can select dark mode by clicking on icon if he want for better view and visualization. 

#### Implementation Details:
- The quiz application will be implemented as a multi-step process, ensuring a logical flow from category selection to quiz completion.
- User progress will be tracked across form steps, with clear visual indicators of the current step.
- Input validation will be enforced at each step to ensure that users make the required selections before proceeding.
- The application will be styled with responsive CSS, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Timer and  hint  functionality will be integrated to enhance the quiz experience, with responsive design elements that adapt to different screen sizes.
- Dark Mode functionality also added for the better view of the application

This project will provide users with an engaging and interactive quiz experience, guiding them seamlessly from start to finish with a clean, responsive, and intuitive interface.
## Available Scripts

To install dependencies , you can run command:

 ### `npm install`


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Future Enhancements: Ideas for additional Feature and Enhancements

1. Advanced Question Types
  ## Timed Question: 
  -Question must be answer in specific time limit

## Image/Vedio Question:
-Support for question that include image or vedio as part of question
 
 ## Drag and Drop:
 --Implements drag and drop where user can match to correct answer

 2. Badges and Achievements
 -- Introduce a system where users can earn badges and achievements based on their performance, such as completing a quiz without any wrong answers or achieving a high score.

 3. Difficulty Levels: 
 --Allow users to select the difficulty level of the quiz, offering beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels with corresponding question difficulty.

4. Custom Quizzes:
--Enable users to create and share their own quizzes by selecting specific categories or topics and setting custom rules (e.g., time limits, number of questions).

5. Leaderboards:
--Implement global or category-specific leaderboards, where users can see how their scores compare to others.

6. Group Quizzes: 
--Introduce a multiplayer mode where users can compete in real-time against friends or other users.
